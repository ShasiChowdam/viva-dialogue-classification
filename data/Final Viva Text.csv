Vinay tell me what is the difference between Fourier transform and short time Fourier transform?,Question
Yes Sir. Difference between Fourier transform and short and Fourier transform correct? And from. So basically. Fourier transform deals with all the speech processing signals. And. For your transform mostly deals with uh so can you repeat the question Sir once?,Answer
What's the difference between Fourier transform and HTT?,Question
Fourier transform and HFT. Ah. I'm not sure what is HFT Sir.,Answer
Some time for your transfer.,Statement
Short term OK. Or short term for your transform. So short term for your transform Sir it's basically a technique which we'll be dealing with the short of the signals which we which will be dividing the signals into segments and like basically those windowing Sir. And it also like each window is analyzed by varying the different time frequency. So it so it basically analyzes those signals in different times different time frequencies using the process of either. Segmentation or computing the windowing process. And it yeah it analyzes the speech signal and. And also generates a spectrogram.,Answer
Correct. What is the output of Fourier transform?,Question
Out of output of for your transform. Yeah transform basically deals with decomposition of the signal. Yeah decomposition of the signal. Either by summing those. Sinusoidal compounds. And yeah magnitude and phase differences.,Answer
And what is the output of STFT?,Question
Top HFT. Output of HDFC deals with like the spectrogram generation. Spectrogram generation and speech analysis and signal processing.,Answer
Yeah but OK now tell me what is the spectrogram?,Question
Spectrogram like yeah spectrogram is a visual representation of the signal in a 2D. Plot. Uh which represents uh. Uh X axis has the time and Y axis as the frequency. Or like it is mainly used for. It is mainly used when the signals are need to be analyzed over that time.,Answer
So both are generating frequencies right?,Question
Yes Sir. Both are generating frequencies.,Answer
So how do you decide where you should use STFT and where to use for your transform?,Question
So STFT is mainly used in audio processing or speech processing system Sir. So and yes Sir.,Answer
No go ahead.,Statement
And four year. Transform is. Transform is basically used in signal processing yeah. So when it is also used in signal processing and and it can be also used in like control system mathematical computation statistics all those for Fourier transform and this spectrogram mainly deals with image processing and speed signal. And audio processing.,Answer
Yes TFT is used in speech processing. And not for your transport. It is also any other signal type.,Statement
Yes Sir. So I think it's basically based on the time frequency analysis part. So if you need a particular segments from the signals no Sir. So I think this STFT is way better than. The Fourier transform. Was will be dealing with a particular time frequency range. So we can improve on the specific range of the signal cell.,Answer
OK very good. We'll move on to Tushar now. Yes Sir. USA. Yes Sir.,Statement

OK so.,Answer
"We use a similarity measure to find out how similar the documents are. How will we? Yes, so you.",Statement
So. Did you hear me?,Question
"Sir, can you please come again? I'm not. Able to hear properly. You have a stable network connection. Aye.",Statement
"Yes, Sir. I'm using college network. Sometimes it will come, sometimes it won't come.",Answer
Then there is no point in having this conversation.,Statement
"So I'll connect to my mobile number for the moment. Oh, oh, yes. Now you can proceed. OK. Can you name some? Similarity metrics which are used in text processing.",Answer
Our text to proceed. We use cosine similarity and one more check out similarities.,Statement
"OK, what is the difference between Jaccard similarity and cosine similarity?",Question
"Different. Like Sir, I just want the formula between those two. As far as I know, like one will measure the importance of the text inside, I mean the words inside those textures and the frequency inside those texts.",Statement
Which one?,Question
I mean question similarity will work with TFIDF. That is like we'll find based on some formula and the in Jaccard similarity we use a bag of words kind of thing to find the frequency of the words in a document.,Answer
What is a bag of word? What is a bag of water?,Question
"Bag of words. Bag of words, Simon. Like it like if we have a normal document we used to have like we used to separate all those words like based on the documents, we'll find the frequency of those words like how many is there inside those document. There's a two types of there's 01. I mean the binary one if you have. The word in that document will mark as one or zero. There's one more thing we can find the frequency how many times the word repeated in the document. That's the total.",Statement
OK.,Answer
"In deep learning, have you heard of something called as a loss function?",Question
Our loss function is.,Statement
What is it?,Question
"Or. Loss function. I mean, I know like to calculate loss function we use like MSCR, MSC and MA values.",Statement
What are they? What is RSC? What is NSC? What is any?,Question
"Those, those are loss functions or Ms. like mean square error. I will find the mean of those predicted values and the actual values based on that will find the the value for RMSC. I guess near 21 or near 20 will considered as best model. Remember RMS near to 1 is the best model I feel. And the other thing is ME and MSC near to 0 the best model film so I don't remember like properly the values.",Statement
OK.,Answer
Where do we? Use loss functions. Why? Why do we need a loss function?,Question
I. Like to compare whether the actual I mean the printed values is correct. I mean is similar to between the printed and actual values.,Statement
"Yeah, but why do you want to do that?",Question
"So so that we'll get to know about our model, Sir. But like whether the model is performing well or not based on something we should find, the model is performing well for like for classification models, we use these. I mean the MSR, MSE, Mae and the MSA values for regression models. I think we use matrices, I guess so.",Answer
"Also sorry. Yeah, but what it is you. To know the performance of the. To like to know the performance of the metrics or whether like it's performing well like we have created something like we got some. Mike. And we got like, based on those, we'll tell whether the model is performing well or not. Sir, we should have some metrics, Sir, to find whether the models are going or not. Like normally we cannot tell whether our like our model is based or not.",Statement
"And knowing whether your model is performing good or not, how does it help you?",Question
"Like. Then we can deploy the model. No, Sir. If, like if it's not, we're getting like very less values for those evaluation metrics. We cannot deploy the model again we we are going to do some preprocessing techniques like data augmentation, normalizations and like we use some dropouts in between. And we use some polling functions. Like so many so that we'll get like extra accuracies and the evaluation materials will be. Model and we can deploy the model on like.",Statement
OK. What is data augmentation?,Question
Data augmentation is like to increase I mean to get rid of overfitting or to increase the accuracy and the evaluation metrics we do.,Statement
You do what?,Question
"So basically like the data set will be given Sir, we'll do some modification in the data set itself, Sir. Like we'll be changing some values in that like whenever we are doing some model training or something, the value for example if we take some image or something. So the pixel range will be from zero to 255 like the range whenever it exceeds or something. The like at that time doing some data augmentation or things. We'll be doing.",Answer
Who is this speaking?,Question
"Sir Nigel, Sir. Sorry for joining date, Sir.",Statement
"OK, miss. What is the difference between data augmentation and dropout?",Question
"So drop out is something like we'll be. So drop code is also function in data no. So drop out like will be leaving some features in the neural network part Sir. So sorry for miscommunication, Sir. I have like very bad network. I'm sorry. OK. Thank you very much. Have a good evening guys. Thank you, Sir. Have a nice day. OK. So Suvretta, please tell me how do we produce speech.",Answer
"Will be produce speech so Sir, when first we breathe in, when we breathe in the air, passes through our layering, there is voice box and voice box consists of vocal chords and two vocal chords. Vocal when. Vocal cords vibrate actually. It's mainly due to the vibration of vocal cords, so each vibration is different, so accordingly sound is produced. But then after that the sound is travelled back and all these mouth, lips, teeth they help in shaping the voice. Shaping the sounds that we speak. Hello.",Statement
OK.,Answer
And how do you perceive sound?,Question
"Perception of sound like how how we speak and when we hear, when we hear sound. So we basically travels through our ear drums. And again, due to the vibration caused around. We listen to sound so.",Statement
And can you hear all kinds of sounds or is there a range of frequencies?,Question
"Yes, yes. Certain range of frequencies only that we hear usually low low frequencies we can high frequencies. It's hard for us to hear like when when there's like lot of sounds distinction between frequencies then it's low it's fine higher the frequency.",Answer
"For which you can do. Course when there's a lot of noise, it's very hard for us to distinguish between the sounds. The humans can hear like a range of 20 to 20,000.",Statement
"Yeah. So so, Surya Meta, what is the human perception range of frequencies?",Question
Hello.,Statement
"Yes, Sir. Human perception range of frequencies. It's around 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz, Sir.",Answer
"OK. Let's say you want to capture all these frequencies, even in a sound, OK. So what should be your sampling frequency so that you are able to capture all these frequencies?",Question
Yes.,Answer
"Sampling frequency should always be it's according to Nyquist criteria, sampling frequency should be. Sampling rate should be greater than equal to the highest frequency of that signal.",Statement
"So. Since you already said that you can hear up to 20 kilohertz frequency sounds, what should be your sampling frequency?",Question
"Yes, Sir. OK, so the sampling frequency this is the first actually not 20,000 Hertz is the highest. So it should be greater than 20 kilohertz the sampling frequency. So 20,001 hours of sampling is enough. Yes, 2 into F Max. So here F Max is 20 kilohertz. So yes, it's it's greater than that. We can here. It should be the sampling criteria.",Answer
Do you think what you agreed and what formula you said they are matching?,Question
"Yes, Sir, it should be always greater than twice the highest frequency. OK, I think when I told I did not mention twice. Sorry. So now please tell me. Yes.",Answer
For for the entire range of. Auditory perceptible. Frequencies. What should be your sampling criteria?,Question
"For humans to hear, Sir.",Statement
Yes.,Answer
"Yeah. So it should be great. Sampling frequency should be greater than 2F Max, so here. If the highest frequency of the signal is 10 kilohertz, then the sampling frequency should be greater than 20 kilohertz.",Statement
"OK. Very good. Now suppose you have sampled it at 20 kilohertz. Yes, Sir.",Answer
And. There actually was a 12 kilohertz frequency present in the signal. What happens to the signal?,Question
"What? What happened? I didn't get you, Sir. The signal had 12 kilohertz frequency component. You need help.",Statement
"Yes, Sir.",Answer
You sample that signal at 20 kilohertz.,Statement
"Yes. So what happens to this? You said that when you are sampling it at. 20 kilohertz the maximum frequency which will stay in the signal is. 10 kilohertz, right. Yes. Now actually the signal had 12 kilohertz frequency. OK. Now, what happens to the frequency component which is 12 kilohertz when you sample it at 20 kilohertz? Radio wants to make. It's. OK. Yes, Sir. So it So what happens to the frequency is less? Then. Like example 12. So you see, we have to.",Answer
"In square. We so we have to filter the signal to remove frequency components to prevent aliasing. That is, that is above F by two. So the cut off frequency we have to remove it to prevent aliasing.",Statement
What is Elias Singh?,Question
"When we do not take the Nyquist criteria into consideration, it will be distorted the output, so it will lead to aliasing. Yes.",Statement
OK. Good. Thank you. We'll move on to. Thank you.,Answer
Bassini.,Statement
"Yes, Sir.",Answer
You are too eager to give answer for her very good. So now please tell me. What is the difference between Fourier transform and short time Fourier transform?,Question
"Fourier transform is when you apply the transformation to the entire signal and the short term Fourier transform is you take like frame by frame or a particular time frame and for that particular time frame you apply the Fourier transform so that you can like if apply for the whole signal you will just get a generalized frequency. Components. Program. But if you apply to each and every frame or a particular time frame, you can study the in detail frequency or the spectrogram components for the entire signal. Applying it on a short term signal, applying your Fourier transform to short time signals or short terms. Instead of the whole signal.",Statement
And why do we do it?,Question
"Uh, we do have short term for it. Confirm to like every time in it's not compulsory, but the frequency remains the same or the spectrogram will be the same throughout the whole signal. Like it keeps. Varying so to understand like in each time instant how much it is varying by how much quantity it is varying and what's the difference? We apply a short term for your transform. So what problem of Fourier transform is taken care by? Using for such time for Fourier transfer. Uh. So.",Answer
"Here, like if you want to understand the sinusoidal frequency or like the face component of a particular local section of the signal, we can use short term for your transform, that is STFT. That is, it keeps changing for every time instance or time period, right? But in when you apply the whole Fourier transform to the entire signal, you are generalizing it. You are not able to get the change like for every time change. How much is the frequency that is changing? So that we can. Understand the short term for returns.",Statement
"OK. Good. For each STFT, good or it is bad?",Question
SDFD Chatham Fourier transform is better. It's definitely comparatively better than your original for your transform you you can do more analysis on this particular spectrum. Is it all good or? There are bad things also.,Statement
"Uh, some of the drawbacks of STFT would be that. Maybe how how you use the windowing function? It depends on whether you take a good windowing function or not. So like if you take the cosine function, cosine sine function would be better than a rectangular function.",Answer
"OK. Now coming to deep learning, can you help me understand where you should use CNN and where you should not use CNN's?",Question
"OK, where we should use CNN and where? We cannot use. OK.",Answer
That's right understanding.,Statement
"Hello. So neural networks, we can use it for like image classification problems or there are many types of CNN. Like R CNN or convolutional neural networks, etc. So it has many applications like image segmentation, image classification. And all of that? Uh. So. Yeah. So can you repeat your question once?",Question
Where should you use CNN and where you should not use CNN.,Statement
"OK, I think CNN's are mostly useful for like feature finding. Or finding like particular pattern in your images or any object or classes or categories like how you put a filter on a particular grid and then you. Move across the. Whole feature map and then you try to get your feature or you understand the background for a particular image. So there we can do CNN, CNN models the. Like I think where you do not use CNN is like you cannot get the global information like overall information like. The yeah, like the overall information from a particular neural network, you may not be able to get. Maybe sometimes in the accuracy and the performance of some models also might. Be very less. So there again is a limitation of CNN.",Answer
"So again, the question is, are CNS all good or there are drawbacks of CNS?",Question
"No, there are some disadvantages of CNN. Even your overfitting problems, they can be overfitting problem if there's no proper data or if you don't do proper activation or regularization functions, and sometimes it can be computationally expensive and there's a lot of layers and you have to use a multiple filter, so it also has its own drawbacks.",Answer
Wonderful. Thank you very much.,Statement
"Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir.",Answer
Goodnight. Then.,Statement
New to your services. Yes. Can you?,Question
"Yes, Sir.",Answer
Please explain what is the difference between a regression problem and a classification problem.,Statement
"OK, so so according to me, what? Of classifying means is. Now, let's take an example. Let's say if a person has diabetes or not. So to classify if a person has diabetes or not. It's just a binary classifier, right? So that a person has or doesn't have. So in this instance, whatever. Columns in that case features that affect it. Whether you have diabetes or not, show that if you actually have it or not. So like there are different factors like age or probably blood pressure or any other medical history. There are conditions wherein you know you have to choose whether it's either either you're having it or not in in case of classifying, there are many instances like. There's either binary classifier or multiclass classifier. So it actually depends on. So this model works on whether you have it. Or. When we go to regression problem in regression problem where there is like OK let's take for an example. We are finding something in yeah, you're trying to regenerate an image in terms of deep learning or something to find out how accurate your images, you don't actually have a class wherein you mean when you can say whether. This is actually an image or not here like you have clusters. Whether you know your on your picture is very very close to that particular cluster or not. So one more difference you can say is that probably in regression based models you can. Metrics involved is probably Mac and a the number of errors. How close you are and in classifying problems that is mostly like F1 or F1. Score accuracy precision. So that's all.",Answer
"Yeah, very good. What is the difference between a fully connected neural network that is a multilayer perceptron network and CNN network? OK, so Sir.",Statement
"OK, now when we talk about fully connected layers, let's let's suppose we have 3 nodes as an initial node and on top of that we have two nodes. So these three nodes are connected to those two nodes continuous in the sense the first node is connected to the top two nodes, the second one the second node and the. We should say is connect to the top 2 nodes and the third one is also connected to the top. Nodes when we talk about. Yeah, here. This is what fully connected layers are when we talk about normal convolution. Again taking the same example, let's take 3 initial and two on the top. So here it is not necessary that all the three initial nodes will have to connect to the top 2 nodes. The first be can be connected to third one, the third, the third initial. The third node can be connected to the the 2nd and the second is the first node and the middle 1 can be. To both. Why are we using it over here? Is because in combination with the network it's it's a little faster, even though like rather than going to the fully connected layers which keep, you know, having a lot of information being sent to each node. Instead we can just connect it to what is important in the conversation neural network. There might be a case of doubt where you might lose information in combination with the network, but it is not happening because at the end of the day every node, I mean every node is connected somehow and somewhere. So finally you will get all the data that is required.",Answer
"Is there any other advantage we have by using? One relation. Other than speed, Sir.",Statement
Yes.,Answer
Probably I can say. It's more efficient. I'm not able to recall any other advantages.,Statement
Why do you say it is more efficient?,Question
"OK. So again, as as as I mentioned earlier also other than speed, it is more efficient in the terms of performing. So as I told you, if the as if the since the speed increases, the memory taken by the time and the memory also slightly lessons. When compared to that of fully connected networks. Hence, I'm calling it efficient.",Answer
"Very good. So you said memory is also consumed is less, right?",Question
"Yes, Sir.",Answer
Why?,Question
"Sir, I didn't. Am am I supposed to say nothing? I didn't hear you, Sir.",Statement
"So my question is, why do? How can you say that memory consumed is less?",Question
"Oh, how can I say that memory comes in? This year, OK, so. How would I suggest this is? OK. So then then we have a fully connected layer connected network. At each node connection you will have to store the data. Basically back propagation or like OK let's take in feed forward propagation as of now. So what does feed feed propagation do like? If you have 3 layers again as the initial stage and two layers and then one again 3 layers as an output. In the feed forward stage, all the nodes in the initial will have to go to the middle with the hidden layer and all the nodes of the hidden layer should also be connected to the final layer. So here this is one layer of data that is going. Now you have to update the weights when you updating the width. Again you have to go back through all these nodes thereby increasing the amount of data and memory load. I'm saying it, I mean here this. Is where I'm saying the word memory. And in the case of convolution neural networks, as I told you, we don't have. We don't the all the neurons will not be connected to the hidden layer as well as the and the final layer. Thereby the data that is propagated in the front, I mean feed feed forwarded or back propagated here the memory. Consumed. I mean the memory used will be less because not all the nodes data has to be stored. For updated.",Statement
OK. Can you tell me one or? Two drawbacks of CNN. OK.,Answer
Where I'm not able to recall the.,Statement
No ground. Do you know of any classifier which which can process sequential data? Sequential data. Probably is it?,Question
Oh.,Statement
So what do you mean by sequential data?,Question
"Sequential data when the current data depends on past data. Oh, OK.",Statement
"So that is it, I. Mean is it very similar to that of the Markov models? I believe so. Probably we could say yeah, recurrent neural networks are and then would also work. For Hazard classifier to check all the what you say the sequential data.",Answer
Your thank you stairs.,Statement
"Thank you so much, Sir. It's fast. Yes.",Answer
What is the difference between MFCC and STFT?,Question
"Sir, for SFTP we basically take short time periods of a speech signal and we try to find short time piece of the speech signal and speech signal and then we apply. For it once on my bag. In MFC we are playing we are playing we we apply for a transfer on short signal short. Short frames of a signal, but then we later also apply IDT and then we apply the we apply. Melt frequency. So basically in STFT we are only finding the we are only applying for a transform, but here we are also applying Mel frequency so Mel frequency. So that we get the output in the in. I'll put in. Output in. Make up.",Statement
"Yes, I'm listening. I mean outputs. How? How human perceives sound. OK.",Answer
What is the difference between Fourier transform and short time Fourier transform? Why do we use STFT? Ohh. So when we apply Ray transform like HFT is basically we use it on short period of short period of. Speech signals so that we can get a better understanding. Of what the?,Question
Ah. What is there in the signal which will help us in which will help us in getting better understanding of the? Better understanding when we try to use it for an application.,Statement
OK. Is there. A drawback of Fourier transform which is getting handled by HFT.,Answer
Oh.,Statement
OK. Would you agree that STFT incurs more computational cost than Fourier transform?,Question
Yes.,Answer
"So. And it is costly for us in terms of computers now. We do it because we expect certain advantage, right?",Question
"Like we use SF for small time periods now, so it will give us more. Accurate results, and like the spectrum, would be more more smoother than. What we'll get some for a time.",Statement
"OK, let's talk about accuracy. Why do you think STFT gives better accuracy?",Question
"Uh. It's trying to focus on a smaller region than than applying for a transform like then applying it. And then like normally it's just will take a small region and then it will apply for a transform on that. So the frequency spectrum which will get from that, it will have a more smoother curve. It will have a much smoother call than. Doesn't. Like if you only apply the traditional traditional for that once. OK, good. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you, Sir. Both of you can drop off.",Answer

OK. What is a spectrogram?,Question
"The problem is disciplinary or the presentation. Those frequency, amplitude and time of residual the time is shown on the X axis. The frequency is shown on the Y axis and the amplitude is shown by the intensity of the color in the ground. OK.",Statement
How is the spectrogram constructed?,Question
We can use still food in the short time we can see. I didn't understand what you said. We can use SPF to construct the spectrogram.,Answer
You can use what?,Question
"Still, short time Fourier transform 2.",Statement
OK so. So why should you use short time Fourier transform? Why not Courier?,Question
"Shut. A short time for the transform gives us a better understanding of spectral components. Basically, since you are taking the frequency analysis for short windows of time, it helps us understand how frequency is changing over time. Instead of this frequency analysis for the entire signal. What is rank of a matrix? 5.",Statement
Yeah.,Answer
Sure. OK.,Statement
Can you give an example of two independent events?,Question
"Independent events are those which do not let the property of one doesn't depend on the property of another, or we can say that. For example, if we are picking the cards from a bunch of from a bunch of cards, that is 52 cards. After picking the card, if we replace the card and pick another card again, then we can say that the two events are independent since the card is being replaced again.",Answer
"With respect to speech analysis, can you? Can you tell me two independent events?",Question
"Yes, Sir. No, please give an example in a speech analysis scenario where 2 independent events are happening. Is.",Answer
Sorry. Love shows.,Statement
You are not sure. OK. What is stemming?,Question
Selling in natural language processing is basically. Standing is it? And then it is cutting off the end at the beginning of the word to obtain the root word basically.,Statement
"Yes. It for example, if we have played it becomes play the ending in prefix and suffix that the ad is removed. Yeah, and the router doesn't necessarily have to have a. The meaningful it doesn't. It is not necessary that the word should have meaning. It can be a meaningless goddess.",Answer
OK. Can you please tell me one or two drawbacks of stemming?,Question
"Ohh yes Sir. If we compare something to. Seven just cuts off the end rate. This double necessarily always end up in obtaining the same root words, because even the two words mean the same. The root word, even if the root word is the same, cutting off just the end does not give the same word. So, since we have obtained non meaningful words, it's not very useful for us. And. The second job was.",Answer
"What are the different regularization? Techniques available in deep learning. Different regularization techniques we have L1 and L2 regularization, L1 is lasso and L2 is regularization. Oh. Those are the two that that.",Statement
OK. What is the difference between declaration and definition in C programming?,Question
"Declaration is basically. For example, if we take INT a, that is the declaration and definition is actually giving it a value that is in a is equal to something, so they're assigning a value to the variable. That would be definition.",Statement
"Very good. Thank you very much. Harshita, Are you ready?",Question
Thank you. So. So.,Statement
So a mother has given birth to two girls. And she is expecting her third child. So the probability of third child being a boy or a girl. Is that a dependent event on the uglier born children or not? So. Sorry Sir my. Network is bad. Can you repeat again?,Question
Your network is back. Sorry Sir. A woman has two daughters. And is expecting her third child. OK. OK.,Statement
The sex of the third child. Whatever the probability is. Is that a dependent event or an independent event in relation to the earlier two children?,Question
So I think it's a independent event.,Statement
Why you think so?,Question
"Because even if like first 2 Childs are girls. It doesn't mean that always the third child will also be a girl. I think so. That you've been the third child will be a boy. There's an equal probability. OK. You have two vectors, 1 vector is. 1/4 dimension dimensional vector. OK.",Statement
And the second vector is A10 dimensional vector. Can you do a dot product between these two vectors?,Question
God.,Statement
I'm not sure.,Answer
No problem. What is cardinality of a set?,Question
I think that. So.,Answer
"What is this hate? What is hate? Cardinality. Cardinality. So it's like a number. I need some row of elements in the set. So if you. Have in a set like 5 #5 elements, then the cardinality. Will be 5. OK. So if there are five members, the cardinality of the set will be 5. Five elements and the cardinality. Of set will be 5. Very good. Suppose you have a set of natural numbers. OK, Sir.",Statement
What is the cardinality of this set?,Question
Set of natural numbers.,Statement
Yes.,Answer
So it's like infinite set or like finite.,Statement
"I have told you what I have. We find exact. Yeah, yeah. Then. I'm not sure about inferring whether we can have a cardinality as infinite or not, but I only know that the number of elements will be the cardinality of this, so I think it's infinite. Infinite. Very good.",Answer
"OK. So you have one set set a which is the set of squares of natural numbers. OK so. And. Then you have a set. B. Which is the set of even numbers. OK, Sir.",Statement
"What is going to be the intersection set of these two sets? Please sit down squares and be sitting. Uh, Sir, it will be, uh. So union. Ohh no. So can you repeat again what is the?",Question
Intersector.,Answer
Uh. So intersection will be the square soft.,Statement
Oh.,Answer
"Even numbers. Very. Good. So yeah. So in a set, if we have. A square so from. One to 10 only the even squares will have the event ending, ending this as even numbers. So when we take the intersection we only get the squares of even numbers. Very good. In Python programming. You are defining your function. And you are using that function. OK, Sir. OK. So what is the? Order of sequence in which there should be done. 1st we will define the function. Whatever we wanna do, just define keyword is used with the name of the function and whatever program we want to do. We think that the function and when you want the exit like. Use that function. We will give the. Input by using the function name. For example, if I'm using the function as even then even of the input, whatever. You want to give.",Statement

"Yes, Sir.",Answer
Tell me what is the use? Of differentiation and integration.,Statement
Use of differentiation and integration in what context? Why are you learning it in that context?,Question
"Why am I learning? Yes, OK. OK. Differentiation in context of, at least in context of speech processing, can be used for feature extraction. And it can also be used, uh, like. Novels are characterized right in different forms, so for form and analysis, and if we talk about integration, we can use it for I think, filtering. Techniques, yeah.",Statement
"Since you spoke about speech processing, is speech stationary signal or non stationary signal?",Question
Stationary symbol. Speech is a non stationary signal.,Statement
Why do you say that? Is that something you learned in signal processing?,Question
"Not necessarily, but I've come across it in a few papers that I've read.",Answer
"So when you say it is non stationary signal, what does it mean? How do you define a non stationary signal?",Question
"That it's. I I know that a stationary signal is when you have like mean, variance etcetera, they stay the same over the time period. So when you say a non stationary signal, I think it's more dynamic so over a period of time. Statistical properties like mean and variance and all that will vary.",Statement
Very good. What is the limitation of perceptron which is overcome by using? Any other network?,Question
"OK. A limitation of a perceptron. Is. I. OK, so we've in deep planning as far as we plan, they have perceptrons have, we've learned with binary inputs zero and one not multiclass. So I think that they can. I mean, as as far as I've learned, they can only produce outputs of 0 and one. So I think multi class classification is not possible with perception.",Statement
"I understand they are not. They are not. It's not possible to generate multiclass classification with perceptron, but why do you say they would only produce zero and one?",Question
"Because even the inputs are typically 0 and so we, I mean it's used for only binary classification tasks like we can take an example of mails. So if you want to classify a mail as spam or not spam or if you want to classify. Some movie with IMDb rating more than 8 or less than 8. Something like.",Statement
Can can I use a perceptron for regression problem?,Question
I don't think Perceptrons can be used for regression problem because for regressions I think the output the sigmoid function ranges from zero to 1. So I don't think it can be used for. Regression tasks.,Answer
What is the role of sigmoid function in perceptron?,Question
OK. I'll. But I I don't know the answer to that question.,Statement
"No problem shruti. Thank you very much. We'll go to samita. Yes, Sir.",Answer

Very good. No problem. At least you have analyzed. That you can.,Statement
"Yes, I have went through the the questions again.",Answer
"More careful next time. Be care more careful next time, OK?",Question
"Yes, Sir.",Answer
Yeah. So you know what? Is your windowing function in speech processing.,Statement
"Can you come again, Sir? What is the windowing function in speech processing?",Question
"So basically, windowing functions are like smooth. Functions like which go through zeros at the borders. So like, it's like by if we multiply the input signal with the windowing function, the windowing function also goes to 0. Yeah. So that the discontinuity at the border becomes invisible.",Statement
OK. Why do we do with the?,Question
"Also windowing, we do it. Sir, because it is used to generate, you know, the magnetic field and transfer the electrical energy.",Statement
"Like, what do you say?",Question
"I'm not able to explain it like properly, but yeah. So like basically to modify the amplitude.",Answer
"So what does mathematically function? I mean, how do you represent a windowing function mathematically? What kind of operation is used to represent a windowing function?",Question
So. Like operation I didn't get it.,Statement
You know what are mathematical operators?,Question
"Yes, like I think the windowing can be mathematical. It it can be mathematically represented in 0 value like in within a chosen interval.",Answer
"Yeah, but what is the operation? You know what are operations?",Question
"So multiplying. Yes, Sir. Multiply. Multiplied. Very good. So we do a multiplying in time domain or in frequency domain. So in time domain. So a multiplication in time domain translates into what kind of operation in frequency domain.",Statement
It translate. It like it's a convolution.,Answer
"OK. So when you are multiplying a window with a signal in time domain, what is happening in frequency domain?",Question
I have no ideas like proper idea.,Answer
So.,Statement
"You said it is convolution, right?",Question
"Yes, Sir.",Answer
Under the convolution loop. Like in normally or like in terms of speech.,Statement
"Whichever way it is convenient for you, you. Can explain that way?",Question
"OK Sir generally. So in figural in mathematical way, it is combining of signals to get a 3rd signal. So it's like it's like come it combines 2 functions by flipping the second and multiplying it. Right. That's all for now. OK.",Statement
Yeah. So how did you feel when you tense?,Question
"Yes, bit.",Answer
Because I started asking very aggressively and tough. Questions. Is it?,Question
"No, Sir, it's not like not only with the subject. Like everywhere, I get tense while answering questions. Like I'll be knowing it. But, you know, while answering it, I might not be able to properly deliver the answer. OK, that takes time for me to.",Answer
"What about you, Shruti?",Question
"But I I don't get very nervous, but I sometimes it depends. If I don't know, I just don't bother wasting too much time on it.",Statement
So why do 10s or not?,Question
"Because it's not graded, I wasn't very tensed. OK. Suppose if you are graded, you would have become tense. A little bit, a little bit. Sure. Thank you very much. Anyway, I basically asked little difficult questions to put you into a stress situation, OK? So that that toll also gets captured in the voice.",Statement
So how did you think I answered?,Question
"I was not evaluating so it was just an answer, OK.",Answer
"OK. Yes, thank you, Sir.",Statement
I don't even remember what questions I asked. Thank you very much.,Answer
